TODO: Code development
======================
 
 * In data parsing, add option to have a third column to specify the array of weight factors

 * Add helper script to format the optimization result as i-PI input

 * Currently configuration files do not have an optimization state (rename to optimizer state), whereas checkpoint files do. Allow configuration files to have that section as well, and initialize to None by default

 * Add final result output to the optimization script

 * implement simulated annealing and/or simplex optimization

 * pytorch?
